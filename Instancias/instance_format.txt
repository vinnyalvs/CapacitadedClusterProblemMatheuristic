CCP Instance format
-------------------

There are 4 folders in the ccplib.zip file:
* Sparse82 - 10 DB instances
* RanReal480 - 20 RanReal instances with n = 480
* RanReal240 - 20 RanReal instances with n = 240
* Handover - 83 Synthetic instances

The format of the three first files is:

The first line has the following fields separed with spaces:
* M: Integer indicating the number of elements
* C: Integer indicating the The number of clusters
* Cluster Type: The value can be "ss" or "ds" and represent "same size cluster" or "different size cluster"
* Cluster limits: Lower and upper limits of each cluster
* Centinel: Letter "W", it has no sense, it is used only as separator
* Node weights: The weight of each node

The following lines contain the distance between elements with
the format: elementA elementB distance

In the case of the Handover files:

*The name of each instance has the following format "N_C_S" where:
    *N - is the number of nodes.
    *C - is the number of clusters.
    *S - is the seed used when generating such instance.

*Each instance encloses the following data:
    *N: Integer indicating the number of nodes
    *C: Integer indicating the number of clusters
    *CC: Double indicating the cluster capacity (all clusters have the same capacity)
    *Node weights: Array of doubles indicating the weight of each node
    *Matrix: Matrix of integers indicating the edge weights between nodes
